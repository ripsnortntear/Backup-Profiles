# Daily Quests

These profiles are designed do your Daily Beastman Tribe quests for you.

They are a copy of Sodimm's Daily Quest profiles that I have modified to use LisbethTravels and made some slight changes to fix non working quests.

You can find Sodimm's original profiles on his repo at https://github.com/sodimm/RebornBuddy

## Setup

You will also need the latest version of LlamaLibrary installed in your botbases folder which can be found here https://github.com/nt153133/__LlamaLibrary
(Make sure you update before running the profiles, Kayla is constantly making new tags for this set and you'll need the absolute latest.)

All my profiles use LisbethTravels for navigation, meaning you will need Lisbeth for them to work. Saga's new Sextant 2.0 is far suprior to anything else RebornBuddy has to offer and makes for a much smoother questing experience. As such, you will need Lisbeth to make these profiles work. If you don't have it, you can find it here: https://www.siune.io/
