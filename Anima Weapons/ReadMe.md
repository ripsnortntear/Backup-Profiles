# Anima Relic Weapons

This profile set is designed to obtain your level 60 Anima weapon with as little interaction from the user as possible.

These profiles are currently no where near finished and I'm not sure they ever will be. The Anima weapons use quite a bit of raid content that I can't automate.

## Setup

Before you start, open the Start.xml and set your desired job to 1, all other jobs to 0. Only set one job to 1 or it will confuse the profiles. You really need to be level 80 to successfully bot these duties. You can do it at lower levels but you will need help on the duties.

Make sure you have completed your class quests up through level 60 to begin the relic quest.

You will also need the latest version of LlamaLibrary installed in your botbases folder which can be found here https://github.com/nt153133/__LlamaLibrary
(Make sure you update before running the profiles, Kayla is constantly making new tags for this set and you'll need the absolute latest.)

I'm in the process of changing over all the movement in this profile to be handled by Lisbeth. Saga's new Sextant 2.0 is far suprior to anything else RebornBuddy has to offer and makes for a much smoother questing experience. As such, you will need Lisbeth to make these profiles work. If you don't have it, you can find it here: https://www.siune.io/

## Known Issues

	For the 4th step of the Animated weapons you will need to obtain Enchanted Rubber, Fast-drying Carboncoat, Divine Water, and Fast-acting Allagan Catalyst.

	You can learn how to obtain these via https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Anima_Weapons/Quest#Coming_into_Its_Own

	I do have a profile to run each of the Alexander fights. You can find then in the Dungeons folder.
	They have varying degree of success based on your job and luck.

	You can also run the various dailies using Sodimm's daily quest profiles.

	Once you obtain the four items start the profile over to continue.
